<p>I'm Ellen. I'm a freelance data consultant based in Canberra, Australia. I'm also an Associate with the <a href="www.theodi.org">Open Data Institute</a>. You can find out more about my professional background at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ellen-broad-316b6732LinkedIn">LinkedIn.</a></p>

<p>I like talking to people about their data projects and plans. I also like talking about other things like films, board games (I even co-designed a <a href="http://theodi.org/news/you-can-now-buy-your-own-copy-of-datopolis-the-open-data-board-game">board game about data</a>) and Beyonce. If wanted to have a chat about something you're working on (or just want to play a data board game), email me at [myfirstname]@ellenbroad.com</p>
