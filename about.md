<p>I'm Ellen. I'm a freelance data consultant based in Canberra, Australia. I'm also an Associate with the <a href="www.theodi.org">Open Data Institute</a>, where I was Head of Policy before moving back to Australia. I've been working in data and digital for six years now, in the UK, Europe and Australia. You can find out more about my professional experience at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ellen-broad-316b6732LinkedIn">LinkedIn.</a></p>

<p>I like talking to people about their data projects and plans. I also like talking about other things like films, board games (I even co-designed a <a href="http://theodi.org/news/you-can-now-buy-your-own-copy-of-datopolis-the-open-data-board-game">board game about data</a>) and Beyonce. If you have a data project you'd like to discuss (or just want to play a data board game), email me at [myfirstname]@ellenbroad.com</p>
