I'm a data policy wonk and aspiring data scientist, who moved back to Australia in September 2016 after working in London, the Hague and Paris.

Until recently I was Head of Policy for the [Open Data Institute](www.theodi.org), an international organisation headquartered in London. Right now I'm a freelance [consultant](http://ellenbroad.com/consulting) while doing postgraduate work in data science.

I like science fiction films, board games and pop music and I like incorporating these into data-related work [wherever I can](https://twitter.com/peterkwells/status/609727042855268352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). I even co-designed a [board game about open data](http://theodi.org/news/you-can-now-buy-your-own-copy-of-datopolis-the-open-data-board-game) with Jeni Tennison that's been picked up in 11 countries.
